# HEALIOS_Thermal_Analysis
The notebook, titled "HEALIOS Thermal Analysis - Algorithm Showcase," is developed by Mateusz Boćko. Its primary purpose is to perform a nodal thermal analysis for a 1U CubeSat satellite (specifically the HEALIOS mission) using a mathematical solver to predict temperatures across different components during an orbit.
